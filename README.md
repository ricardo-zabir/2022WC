# World Cup 2022 Predictor

This project predicts the results of the 2022 World Cup matches. It was written using Typescript and Node.Js. Note that it uses a pre-established level
for each national team which is set in the TeamsLevels.json file. There is also a huge randomic factor in each match which allows for a bunch of upsets, trying
to emulate the surprise factor present in football
